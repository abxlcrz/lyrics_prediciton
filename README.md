# Lyrics prediction
## Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks with Markov Chains in order to predict music lyrics

### by [Alex Ingberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexingberg/)

Currently done:
  - Lyrics in Spanish from [Luis Alberto Spinetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Alberto_Spinetta)

Pulled lyrics from Genius API and guided myself with Spotify Web API. Run two different kind of models and compared the modelling, the development and the outcome.

This whole project has been created using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

I created the databases with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
